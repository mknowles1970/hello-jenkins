Each region contains multiple distinct locations called Availability Zones
To make the subnet public, let’s add an Internet Gateway and route all outbound traffic through it
etcd is a distributed, consistent key-value store used for storing shared configuration and information in a cluster
Multiple availability zones = different data centers
old type scaling is vertical - cloud scaling is horizontal scale out
Cloudwatch - Monitoring via alarms
cloudfront - webserver cache
Autoscaling Cloudformation - templating a full stack of VM's
Amazon SNS - Mails alerts
Amazon SES - Mailing system for mass emails (like authsmtp.com)

AutoScaling
download autoscaling tools then run
as-create-launch-config 
as-create-auto-scaling-group
as-put-scaling-policy

CloudBerry Explorer for Windows allows you to have a GUI explorer view on S3 Buckets
